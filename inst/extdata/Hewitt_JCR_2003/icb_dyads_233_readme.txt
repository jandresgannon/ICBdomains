INFORMATION ABOUT icb_dyads_233.sav
-----------------------------------

This file contains information about 233 crisis dyads that were
computed from strictly bilateral crises. For reasons described in the 
article, it would be problematic to conduct the analysis reported in
Table 3 on dyads computed from multilateral crises.

The file contains variables corresponding to MID dyads that match with
a crisis dyad. The MID dyad variables will have missing values for any
crisis dyad that does not match with a MID dyad. The SPSS command job
table_3.sps reads this file and generates Table 3 from the article.
