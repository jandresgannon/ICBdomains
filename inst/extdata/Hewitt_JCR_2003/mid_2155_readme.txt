mid_2155.sav contains information about 2155 MID dyads from the 1918-1992 period. The

dyad. Crisis dyad variables will have missing values for any MID dyad that does not 
match with a crisis dyad. The SPSS command job table_1_and_2.sps reads this file and 
generates Tables 1 and 2 from the article.
